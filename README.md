# agile-final-project
Backend product catalog for an e-commerce website

DONE Create a new GitHub repository called "agile-final-project" and make sure that it is public. 

DONE Create a workspace in ZenHub called "Final Project" that is linked to the repository. 

Create an issue template for the new repository like you did in the labs. 

Create issues for the stakeholder requirements listed above (10 in all). For now, just fill in the "As a... I need... So that..." section of the template. 

Move the issues that represent requirements 7 and 8 into the Icebox. 

Move the remaining issues into the Product Backlog. 

Conduct a Backlog Refinement meeting and rank the Product Backlog so that the stories match the requirements above in the order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 5, & 6. 

Update the top 5 stories in the Product Backlog with acceptance criteria following the Gherkin "Given... When... Then..." syntax. 

Create a "technical debt" label. 

Add labels to all the stories in the Product Backlog of either "enhancement" or "technical debt". 

Create a sprint milestone with a duration of 2 weeks, with the name "Sprint 1" in the title, and a sprint goal in the description.

Conduct a Sprint Planning meeting. Add the top 4 stories to the sprint by assigning them to the sprint milestone. Assign story points estimates.  Move these 4 stories to the Sprint Backlog. 

Simulate a sprint by assigning the top story to yourself. Then move this story to the In Progress pipeline. 

Move the story that you just assigned to yourself to Review/QA. Take the next story from the Sprint Backlog and assign it to yourself.  Move it to the In Progress pipeline. 

Move the story in Review/QA to Done. Move the story from In Progress to Review/QA. Take the next story off the Sprint Backlog, assign it to yourself, and move it to the In Progress pipeline. 

Move the story that is left in Review/QA to Done. Leave the story that is in the In Progress pipeline where it is. This is the end of the sprint. 

Make sure that your burndown chart displays correctly.
